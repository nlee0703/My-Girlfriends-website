<h1>A Letter To You <3</h1>
<p>I wrote a little something for you my love <3</p>
<br>
<p>
HIII my love we've finally made it to our 1-month together it may have been a little bit rough at the start, and it may
have been a bit of a bumpy road for us. However, I'm so glad we made it to this point together still I was honestly
super scared for a lot of the times in the beginning because I really thought I would lose you pretty early on from all
the stupid mistakes I would make. I know my emotional skills and awareness aren't the best, and it has brought us a lot
of pain from it, but you still endured it staying with me up until now. I know I know 1-month isn't that long but like
in this day and age most people would be happy to even see past 2 weeks LOL. ANYWAYS...no more joking around I just
wanted to tell you how much I LOVE YOU and APPRECIATE you because you really mean the whole world to me my love. You
really have been through a lot just for me all of our ups and downs will always have a special place in my heart, and
stay as beautiful memories that I can always look back on or just think about during my lowest times. Once again happy
1-month baby I love you. You may not be seeing this on the day of because I suck at coding and this is taking me forever,
but I'm trying to get this done as soon as I can I swear!!!!
